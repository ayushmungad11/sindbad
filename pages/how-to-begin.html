                The future of food-service industry looks bright, however like
                all other businesses, there are no guarantees. The most

                path to be one.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the restaurants fail (about 70%) in the first year of
                its operation and “lack of planning & knowledge” is the top
                reason. It is a great business, a lovely one with the glamour
                and love around it but there are a thousand strings that need to
                be in place, pulled & pushed just in the right way. Though there
                is no 100% fool-proof way to success, here are a few points that
                sure won’t let you fail if followed to the T.

              <h2>2.0 Restaurant Types:</h2>
              <p>
                Before we move further, here are the types of food-service
                business:<br />
                - Multi-cuisine Restaurant<br />
                - Cafe <br />
                - Restro-Cafe<br />
                - Dhaba<br />
                - Food Truck<br />
                - Cloud Kitchen<br />
                - Specialty restaurant / joint<br />
                - Coffee Shop <br />
                - Bakery<br />
                - Fast Food
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember that no business can capture the entire market. You
                simply cannot. So your focus should be based on the market based
                on the concept and capture that start to end. Forget the rest.

                >
                You can delight your customers with experience but they need not
                be surprised all the time; meaning you need not think
                differently compulsorily when it comes to concept. We have seen
                restaurants with unique features failing simply because it was
                so unique. Yes, you read that right. For example, a simple
                family fine-dine restaurant may work better than a hi-end
                expensive lounge at a location which has dense family
                population. So either decide a concept based on location, or
                decide a location based on concept.

                Meeting & hosting a guest with grace is not the only part of a
                restaurateur's life. A lot of time should be dedicated to
                creating the right menu & recipe, grocery inventory management,
                managing staff; strategizing & executing marketing ideas;
                accounting & daily cash flow, running the show in line with
                local govt authorities etc. Whichever food-service business you
                start, the best way to learn the trick is to work for similar
                set-up for sometime or hiring the right consultant with a
                proven-track record.

                <span style="font-weight: 600">> Location :</span> As you
                explore the ideal location for your restaurant, ask yourself
                these questions:<br />
                Why is this location perfect for my restaurant?<br />

                What is the eating-out population in this area?<br />

                Do people of this area believe in spending in restaurants?<br />

                Will people from other nearby areas travel to this area?<br />
                That question being answered, remember that a ground floor (or
                rooftops, may be) locations are anyday better than any other
                floor. Parking woes are not to be ignored at all. You may have
                to compromise a little somewhere but it’s better to wait for the
                right location than to fall prey to a compromised one. If you
                are renting it out, cross-check the rent in your business plan
                and see the feasibility of revenues. I personally prefer to
                visit the location at multiple times (day time, night hours,
                peak hours, weekdays, weekends) to get a hang of the kind of
                people visiting the area.

              <h2>3.0 Restaurant Business Plan:</h2>
              <p>
                Your business plan should consist of all business components
                like CAPEX and OPEX. The CAPEX (capital expense / investment)
                should have detailed working of how / when / where / why are you
                spending. Question yourself why or how an investment on a
                particular thing will help you run your business profitably.
                Likewise for OPEX (operating expense), jot down each component
                like rent, salary, grocery, utilities, etc and run the excel
                calculation for 24 months atleast. Remember this is the most
                critical part of your business even if it sounds boring to do
                so. Your restaurant, like any other business, will incur loss
                for the first few months. Make provision for these losses in
                your business plan (I prefer to put this in CAPEX). Keep some
                fund aside for the unforeseen circumstances (Pandemic, New Govt
                rules, some construction work etc for example). Also, you may
                like to add a plan B or an exit plan in your business plan.
                <br />
                The following will help you create your business plan for your
                restaurant in a better way. <br />
                - Per week sales anticipation <br />

                - How to achieve those sales figure. <br />

                - What is your operating break even month on month and how will
                you achieve those numbers <br />

                - Competition revenue & operations mapping <br />

                - Future of your business – think long term, think expansion,
                think growing / type of population <br />

                - Don’t over-estimate your ‘prime location’ <br />

                - Don’t under-estimate the power of great prelaunch marketing.
                <br />

                think whether your restaurant will be profitable given, say 60%

              <h2>4.0 Menu :</h2>
              <p>
                The golden rule is to cook what your guests want & not what you
                want them to eat. Too much variety in menu may increase your
                food cost, may load your staff, deteriorate quality, finally
                leading to loss overall. In other words, as you put together a
                plan for your food-service business, be aware of some of the
                trends in terms of menu content and design. These factors
                could--and, in fact, should--influence the type of food-service
                business you open. Cross check your rates of dishes with
                successful restaurants in your area. Decreasing or increasing
                the rate by 5-7% will not impact positively or negatively but
                try to keep the food cost at an ideal rate of 30% of what you
                charge. This should be averaged out overall, for easier
                calculation.

              <h2>5.0 Staffing & Training:</h2>
              <p>
                One of the biggest challenges businesses in all industries face
                is a lack of qualified labor. As the food-service industry in
                general continues to grow and thrive, the demand for workers in
                an already-diminished labor pool is also increasing. Finding
                qualified workers, rising labor costs & high attrition rate are
                key concerns for food-service business owners. Empanelling a
                staff provider (HR Consultant) will help you a lot in hiring the
                right staff as per your menu. There are several categories of
                personnel in the restaurant business: manager, cooks, servers,
                busboys, dishwashers, hosts and bartenders. When your restaurant
                is still new, some employees' duties may cross over from one
                category to another. For example, your manager may double as the
                host, and servers may also bus tables. Be sure to hire people
                who are willing to be flexible in their duties. Your payroll
                costs should be about 24 to 35 percent of your total gross
                sales.

              <h2>6.0 Marketing</h2>
              <p>
                Every business needs a marketing plan, and your food-service
                business is no exception. Remember that word-of-mouth is still
                the best method of advertising but don’t forget that you need to
                cater to a large number of guests before you rely solely on it.
                No studies are required to know that Social Media, platforms
                like <a href="https://www.cityshor.com/">CityShor</a>, Zomato,
                local food bloggers, etc are the best ones for any food-service
                business. Make sure to come up with a strong prelaunch, launch &
                post-launch marketing strategy. Marketing is the only way
                customers will know you exist. Don’t rely on your ‘prime
                location and beautiful signage board’ - most of the
                restaurateurs tend to go wrong here. Keep a tab on the source of
                information through which customers have come. This will help
                you strengthen your marketing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, step back and take a look at each element in your
                facility. Everything from the parking lot to the interior decor
                to the printed items contributes to your marketing message--and
                each should be an accurate reflection of what that message is.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of day, rely more on the data & less on gut-feel but
                do not ignore your gut feel totally.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have read all above and still wondering whether or not to

            >You can delight your customers with experience but they need not be
            surprised all the time; meaning you need not think differently
            compulsorily when it comes to concept. We have seen restaurants with
            unique features failing simply because it was so unique. Yes, you
            read that right. For example, a simple family fine-dine restaurant
            may work better than a hi-end expensive lounge at a location which
            has dense family population. So either decide a concept based on
            location, or decide a location based on concept. <br />

            >Meeting & hosting a guest with grace is not the only part of a

            staff; strategizing & executing marketing ideas; accounting & daily
            cash flow, running the show in line with local govt authorities etc.
            Whichever food-service business you start, the best way to learn the
            trick is to work for similar set-up for sometime or hiring the right

            <span style="font-size: 6rem">> Location :</span>As you explore the
            ideal location for your restaurant, ask yourself these questions:
            <br />
            Why is this location perfect for my restaurant?<br />
            What is the eating-out population in this area?<br />
            Do people of this area believe in spending in restaurants?<br />
            Will people from other nearby areas travel to this area?<br />
            That question being answered, remember that a ground floor (or
            rooftops, may be) locations are anyday better than any other floor.
            <br />
            Parking woes are not to be ignored at all. You may have to
            compromise a little somewhere but it’s better to wait for the right
            location than to fall prey to a compromised one. If you are renting
            it out, cross-check the rent in your business plan and see the
            feasibility of revenues. I personally prefer to visit the location
            at multiple times (day time, night hours, peak hours, weekdays,
            weekends) to get a hang of the kind of people visiting the area.

          <div>
            Your business plan should consist of all business components like
            CAPEX and OPEX. The CAPEX (capital expense / investment) should have
            detailed working of how / when / where / why are you spending.
            Question yourself why or how an investment on a particular thing
            will help you run your business profitably. Likewise for OPEX
            (operating expense), jot down each component like rent, salary,
            grocery, utilities, etc and run the excel calculation for 24 months
            atleast. Remember this is the most critical part of your business
            even if it sounds boring to do so. Your restaurant, like any other
            business, will incur loss for the first few months. Make provision
            for these losses in your business plan (I prefer to put this in
            CAPEX). Keep some fund aside for the unforeseen circumstances
            (Pandemic, New Govt rules, some construction work etc for example).
            Also, you may like to add a plan B or an exit plan in your business

            The golden rule is to cook what your guests want & not what you want
            them to eat. Too much variety in menu may increase your food cost,
            may load your staff, deteriorate quality, finally leading to loss
            overall. In other words, as you put together a plan for your
            food-service business, be aware of some of the trends in terms of
            menu content and design. These factors could--and, in fact,
            should--influence the type of food-service business you open. Cross
            check your rates of dishes with successful restaurants in your area.
            Decreasing or increasing the rate by 5-7% will not impact positively
            or negatively but try to keep the food cost at an ideal rate of 30%
            of what you charge. This should be averaged out overall, for easier
            calculation.

          <div>
            One of the biggest challenges businesses in all industries face is a
            lack of qualified labor. As the food-service industry in general
            continues to grow and thrive, the demand for workers in an
            already-diminished labor pool is also increasing. Finding qualified
            workers, rising labor costs & high attrition rate are key concerns
            for food-service business owners. Empanelling a staff provider (HR
            Consultant) will help you a lot in hiring the right staff as per
            your menu. There are several categories of personnel in the
            restaurant business: manager, cooks, servers, busboys, dishwashers,
            hosts and bartenders. When your restaurant is still new, some
            employees' duties may cross over from one category to another. For
            example, your manager may double as the host, and servers may also
            bus tables. Be sure to hire people who are willing to be flexible in
            their duties. Your payroll costs should be about 24 to 35 percent of
            your total gross sales.

          <div>
            Every business needs a marketing plan, and your food-service
            business is no exception. Remember that word-of-mouth is still the
            best method of advertising but don’t forget that you need to cater
            to a large number of guests before you rely solely on it. No studies

            >
            , Zomato, local food bloggers, etc are the best ones for any
            food-service business. Make sure to come up with a strong prelaunch,
            launch & post-launch marketing strategy. Marketing is the only way
            customers will know you exist. Don’t rely on your ‘prime location
            and beautiful signage board’ - most of the restaurateurs tend to go
            wrong here. Keep a tab on the source of information through which
            customers have come. This will help you strengthen your marketing.

            Everything from the parking lot to the interior decor to the printed

              The future of food-service industry looks bright, however like all

            <p style="padding-top: 10px">
              Most of the restaurants fail (about 70%) in the first year of its
              operation and “lack of planning & knowledge” is the top reason. It
              is a great business, a lovely one with the glamour and love around

              food-service business. Make sure to come up with a strong
              prelaunch, launch & post-launch marketing strategy. Marketing is
              the only way customers will know you exist. Don’t rely on your
              ‘prime location and beautiful signage board’ - most of the
              restaurateurs tend to go wrong here. Keep a tab on the source of
              information through which customers have come. This will help you
              strengthen your marketing.

              Next, step back and take a look at each element in your facility.
              Everything from the parking lot to the interior decor to the
              printed items contributes to your marketing message--and each
              should be an accurate reflection of what that message is.

              At the end of day, rely more on the data & less on gut-feel but do
              not ignore your gut feel totally.

              If you have read all above and still wondering whether or not to
              get in the business OR which kind of food service business you
              should do based on current trend ... we are just a call away and
              we don’t charge for suggestions or a little help :)
